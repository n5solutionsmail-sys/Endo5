## EndoCool is an energy saving additive for any chilled water system.

### EndoCool changes the properties of the secondary circuit fluid and increases the efficiency of hydronic chiller systems.

According to estimates, 40% of the world’s electricity is used for air conditioning and building cooling.

Many commercial and industrial cooling systems rely on chilled water to distribute cool air around a building.

These electrically driven systems can be a large expenditure for building owners and operators.

EndoCool is a product designed for chilled water systems to reduce energy consumption and carbon footprint.

**EndoCool was piloted by a 54-storey mixed-use building in Dubai’s central business district.**

The building is connected to a district energy system and requires constant air chilling for comfort cooling.

**EndoCool saved 13.76% on cooling energy consumption over 10 months, with full ROI delivered in under 12 months.**

[Case Studies](https://www.endocool.com/energy-saving-case-studies/)

### EndoCool can be used in conjunction with glycols and other anti-freeze technology and can help improve system efficiencies compared to water-only systems.

HVAC hydronic fluid viscosity is often increased when chilled water systems are dosed with anti-freeze chemicals. In spite of providing freeze protection, this can significantly reduce the fluid flow rates.

The result can often be excessive pumping and running times, which in turn increases energy consumption. By changing the properties of the system fluid, EndoCool can improve the operation and efficiency of the chiller system.

EndoCool is a cost effective, easy to install, energy saving measure that provides the following optimisations to any water cooled chiller system:
